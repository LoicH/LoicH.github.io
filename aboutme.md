I am Loïc Herbelot, a French data science student. 


## My history

### September 2016 - August 2018: 2-year apprenticeship at Trusted Labs

I am doing lot of security-related development. I use mainly Java to improve the software, and some C and python on the side. I use machine learning techniques to improve software attacks, such as reducing the quantity of information needed to perform an attack.

### September 2017 - February 2018: 6 months of Data Science studies at UPMC
#### (Université Pierre et Marie Curie)

I participated in the "Data, Learning and Knowledge" curriculum (in French: "Données, Apprentissage et Connaissances") in one of the biggest universities in France. This semester covers lots of topics about machine learning, data science and big data, with classes such as ["Databases at large scale"](https://github.com/LoicH/M2-DAC/tree/master/BDLE), ["Data mining and social media"](https://github.com/LoicH/FDMS), ["Information retrieval"](https://github.com/LoicH/RI/) or "Modeling and reasoning with incomplete knowledge". 

### September 2015 - August 2018: 3 year of Computer Science studies at Télécom ParisTech 
#### With a specialization in Data Sciences

I did my Engineering Master at Telecom ParisTech, one of the best engineering schools in France. I did one year of generic computer science with various courses about programming, operating systems, calculus, probabilities, information theory, and projects such as [my first-year data mining & visualization project](https://github.com/LoicH/aps). I then specialized in data sciences and focused on machine learning, data base management, optimization and statistics, while doing an apprenticeship in a security firm to learn about security and how it works in the real world. My 3rd year consisted of one semester of courses about Data Science at Université Pierre et Marie Curie and one semester of internship in the same security company.
